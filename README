This is Yet Another Juggling Animator, a largely abandoned club passing pattern animator. It runs, with a lot of bugs, under recent versions of Racket. It was originally built as an experiment in multi-hand siteswap, became an experiment in building patterns as scheme values, and can still serve as a didactic tool via the built-in pattern list.

Run juggling-main.rkt with 'racket' or DrRacket. The most functional parts of the interface are pattern selection on the right hand side, and the 4/6 hand siteswap entry areas on the bottom.
